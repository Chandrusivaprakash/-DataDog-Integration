                            DataDog Integration with React Application

1. Create a React-based web application:

I Set up a new React project using Create React App .

2. Use the DataDog API to fetch values and show them in a table format:

Setting up DataDog API access involves obtaining My DataDog API key and application key, which are required for authenticating your API requests :

Fetch Data from DataDog API Monitor

fetch data from the DataDog API.
Use Axios or to make a GET request to the DataDog API endpoint for fetching monitors metrics data.
Parse the API response and display the data in your React components.

3. To create a monitor in the Datadog application: In a React
Application add a button under the table (“Create New Monitor”). While
clicking the button, a popup should be displayed with form.

Add a button in My React app to create a new monitor in bottom of Table.

Implement a popup/modal component to display a form for creating a new monitor. 
Handle form submission by making a POST request to the DataDog API endpoint for creating monitors.
